### My Findings
- In jelly,
    - All PSNR curves exhibit periodic variation except for softening. I assume this is due to the regular oscillation of the moving stick in the video, which causes consistent deformations and periodic drops in PSNR values.

    - The softening curve has the highest average PSNR among all (although it drops with time). I assume that increasing the softening factor leads to deformations that resemble the ground truth more closely, thus maintaining higher PSNR and reducing sensitivity to stick movement.

    - The substep_dt curve shows visible fluctuations, especially during impact moments. I assume that improper time stepping causes instability during high-speed interactions, leading to sudden visual artifacts and PSNR drops.

    - The double-peak patterns observed in the later frames may indicate aliasing or inaccurate resolution of force propagation when substep_dt is not well-tuned. This suggests that tuning substep size is critical for stable and accurate rendering of dynamic materials like jelly.

    - The grid_v_damping_scale curve varies periodically as well. I assume that excessive damping suppresses natural motion, while insufficient damping causes overreaction upon collision. Both affect the visual realism and PSNR values cyclically.

    - The n_grid curve fluctuates more irregularly. I assume that mismatched resolution between grid and particles causes aliasing or oversmoothing, which becomes more apparent during deformation, thus degrading PSNR.
- In sand,
    - All PSNR curves, except for softening, exhibit a consistent and monotonic decay throughout the frames. I assume that this drop reflects the accumulation of simulation error or resolution mismatch as the material behavior becomes more complex over time.

    - The lack of periodicity indicates that the sand motion is relatively stable and does not involve repetitive or oscillatory deformation like jelly.

    - The softening curve also decreases over time but maintains high PSNR for a longer duration, with a steep drop occurring only after frame 20. I assume that softening won't affect the PSNR values.

## Bonus
To automatically infer material parameters in PhysGaussian, we can design a neural framework that takes input video or multiview sequences and predicts simulation parameters (e.g., softening, damping, grid resolution). This prediction model (e.g., CNN or Transformer) can be trained end-to-end by comparing the rendered results from PhysGaussian (using predicted parameters) with the input video using image-based losses (like PSNR or LPIPS). This enables generalization to unknown materials without manual tuning.
